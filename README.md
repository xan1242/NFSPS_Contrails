# NFS Pro Street - Contrails

This is a simple backport of AddXenonEffect to the CarRenderConn::OnRender from NFS Carbon.

Most of the functionality already was present in Pro Street, so not much work had to be done to get it fully operational.

The only bug was with the transformations, which was fixed by changing the shader.

You may reconfigure this similarly to my NFSMW_XenonEffects project.
